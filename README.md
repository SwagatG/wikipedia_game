While creating this game, we decided to take a twist on the classic Wikipedia game that every child has undoubtedly played while growing up. The rules of the game is as follows:
- a starting Wikipedia page is defined
- an target Wikipedia page is defined
- the player must start from the starting Wikipedia page and get to the target Wikipedia page whilst only clicking embedded links on each Wikipedia page
- the goal of the game is to simply reduce the number of clicked links needed to get from the starting page to the target page

Our team decided to create a web app that requires the use of smart bots in order to solve the classic Wikipedia game with maximized efficiency.  
We also decided to use ChartJS to represent the path between pages, as well as the proximity at each stage.
